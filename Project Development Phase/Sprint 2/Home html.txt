<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
<p>Liver diseases avert the normal function of the liver. Mainly due to the large amount of alcohol consumption liver disease arises. Early prediction of liver disease using classification algorithms is an efficacious task that can help the doctors to diagnose the disease within a short duration of time. Discovering the existence of liver disease at an early stage is a complex task for the doctors. The main objective of this project is to analyze the parameters of various classification algorithms and compare their predictive accuracies so as to find out the best classifier for determining the liver disease.This paper focus on the related works of various authors on liver disease such that algorithms where implemented using Weka tool that is a machine learning software written in java.Various attributes that are essential in the prediction of liver disease where examined and the dataset of liver patients were also evaluated.This paper compares various classification algorithm such as Random Forest ,Logistic Regression and Separation Algorithm with an aim to identify the best technique based on Study,Random Forest with the highest accuracy outperformed the other algorithms and can be further utilised in the prediction of liver disease recommended. </p></h2>
